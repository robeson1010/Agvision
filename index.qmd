# Overview

To facilitate the global collaboration across a wide range of communities and promote development of novel AI-enabled applications in agriculture, forestry and grassland, addressing food security and sustainability, we will continue hold the second kaggle competition that consists of two parts including 1) Automated Crop Disease Diagnosis from Hyperspectral Imagery; 2) Boosting automatic crop type classification using Sentinel satellite data and self-supervised learning.



## Part 1 Automated Crop Disease Diagnosis from Hyperspectral Imagery

Early accurate diagnosis and quantification of crop diseases are crucial for precision management by allowing targeted interventions at the field level. Effective diagnosis and control measures are dependent on symptom recognition and severity assessment (in the vast majority of cases, diseases exhibit a range of visual symptoms, e.g. coloured spots or streaks). At present, these are mainly achieved by visual observation and estimation.

Recent advancements in digital imaging have facilitated the development of a variety of image-based methods for plant management that are capable of performing automated image acquisition and analysis. These methods have shown great potential for automated crop disease diagnosis based on images from RGB (red, green and blue), thermal, multispectral, and hyperspectral sensors.

Particularly, hyperspectral imagery (HSI), which contains more narrow spectral bands over a contiguous spectral range, provides detailed spectral--spatial information of the disease infestation and offers the potential to provide better diagnostic accuracy.

In this challenge, we will provide a hyperspectral image dataset of wheat fields with yellow rust disease. We mainly focus on the accurate diagnosis of crop diseases from hyperspectral imagery (in this case, yellow rust disease). The benchmark model for this competition is based on our published paper on remote sensing \[1\].

## Part 2 Boosting automatic crop type classification using Sentinel satellite data and self-supervised learning


The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that current agricultural production needs to grow by up to 70 percent by 2050 in order to meet the expected population growth on Earth. This poses a significant challenge for food production, which requires solutions that not only enhance agricultural methods but also adapt them radically to environmental pressures. Big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to play a vital role in this process.

The crop type classification is an important part of agriculture as an industry. Remote sensing data offers large scale, long term, continuous monitoring on the ground and has long been used as an extremely useful tool for crop classification. Identifying crops using traditional supervised learning methods can be a challenging task, as obtaining a large number of ground-truthing training samples is often a time-consuming and laborious work.


In recent years, there has been a new research trend to train models without using labels, named Self-supervised learning (SSL). It has been effectively applied in many fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and object detection. In fact, by extracting representative features from unlabelled data, the SSL algorithm has outperformed supervised pre-training on many problems. In this respect, self-supervised learning is a promising avenue for remote sensing research  \[2\].


In this challenge, we will release a massive remote sensing dataset in cropland area, including multispectral and SAR data for participants to train their self-supervised learning models. A crop classification task will be set up to evaluate the effectiveness of their SSL model.
