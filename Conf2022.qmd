To facilitate the in-depth applications of remote sensing technology in intelligent plant protection, disaster monitoring and forecasting, ecological security, etc., the cross-disciplinary integration and technology innovations of monitoring, early warning, and prevention and control of vegetation pests and diseases will be fully investigated. It is to promote the theoretical innovations and industrial applications of remote sensing of vegetation pests and diseases, and to build an ecological civilization, pursue the harmonious coexistence of man and nature and build a community of all life on Earth.

The conference will gather scientists from various fields such as remote sensing, plant protection, ecology, environment, meteorology, artificial intelligence, ethics of science and technology, etc. It focuses on the biodiversity protection, green prevention and control of pests and diseases, ecological security assessment of agriculture, forestry, prataculture, etc. The latest scientific achievements and future development trend of theories, models, methods, systems and applications will be deeply explored concerning the remote sensing based key applications of monitoring, early warning, prevention and control of vegetation pests and diseases.

One of the key objectives of the conference is to facilitate cross-disciplinary and industry-academia-research-application integration, and to promote the theoretical research, methodology innovation, technology extension and application demonstration of remote sensing in the field of vegetation pests and diseases. The domestic and international experts and scholars involved in the remote sensing-based studies on vegetation pests and diseases will be invited to present the academic reports during the conference.
